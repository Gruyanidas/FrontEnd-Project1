## My process

Using pretty basic knowledge I managed to recreate this QR code chalenge. However I got confused about dimensions described in a guide so I did only solution for a desktop version. Would like a brief explanation how to implement size for mob phone version in future projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Nothing special, just applied basic knowledge and this was a nice warming up project.


### Continued development

I would like to practice on more similar projects.
